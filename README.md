# ü©∫ Applying Design Patterns in Health Monitoring App

A Java Swing-based health monitoring application designed to **demonstrate and apply five key object-oriented design patterns**: **Singleton**, **Factory Method**, **Composite**, **Facade**, and **Memento**.

### üÜö Comparison: Before vs. After Design Patterns

| Aspect              | Original Design                | After Refactoring with Patterns        |
|---------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Structure           | Flat and tightly coupled       | Modular and layered using patterns     |
| Reusability         | Low                            | High through interfaces and factories  |
| Maintainability     | Harder to update or extend     | Easier with pattern separation         |
| Complexity Handling | Centralized in few classes     | Distributed logically via patterns     |

## üöÄ Project Overview

This application allows users to securely log in and track essential health metrics via a questionnaire-based interface. It includes features such as password recovery, hierarchical doctor-patient management, support access, session management, and report saving. The project highlights how well-known design patterns can organize, simplify, and enhance application design.

## üìÅ Architecture & Design Patterns

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**
- **Intent**: Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access.
- **Usage**: Used in the `Login` component to ensure only a single login window/session is active.
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents multiple login dialogues.
  - Manages shared user-session data globally and efficiently.

### 2. **Factory Method Pattern**
- **Intent**: Defines an interface for creating an object, letting subclasses determine which class to instantiate.
- **Usage**: Used to generate variation-specific UI components (e.g., city-based login windows or health-monitoring configurations).
- **Benefits**:
  - Decouples object creation from application logic.
  - Promotes extension for future variants without modifying core code.

### 3. **Composite Pattern**
- **Intent**: Compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Clients treat individuals and compositions uniformly.
- **Usage**: `Doctor` and `Patient` implement the `HealthcareComponent` interface. Doctors can contain other doctors or patients recursively.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies hierarchical relationship management.
  - Enables consistent operations over nested structures.
  - Supports scalable, complex organizational models.

### 4. **Facade Pattern**
- **Intent**: Provide a unified, simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- **Usage**: `AppFacade` simplifies interactions among login, questionnaire, support, and report subsystems.
- **Benefits**:
  - Hides complexity of subsystems.
  - Reduces coupling between UI and back-end logic.
  - Streamlines navigation flows and orchestration.

### 5. **Memento Pattern**
- **Intent**: Capture and externalize an object‚Äôs internal state so it can be restored later without violating encapsulation.
- **Usage**: Used to save and restore user‚Äôs health questionnaire input or report text state in `Monitoring_Record_Window`.
- **Benefits**:
  - Enables undo/redo and recovery from accidental data loss.
  - Maintains UI state without exposing internal structure.
  - Enhances user experience by preventing loss of input.
